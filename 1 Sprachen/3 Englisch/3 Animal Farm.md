## Animal Farm - Analysis
In Animal Farm, the pigs put up 7 commandments:
	1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
	2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend
	3. No animal shall wear clothes
	4. No animal shall sleep in a bed
	5. No animal shall drink alcohol
	6. No animal shall kill any other animal
	7. All animals are equal.
These commandments all have been broken at some point in the story. For example, the pigs begin to sleep in the farmhouse, drink alcohol, wear clothes, walk on two legs, kill each other.
When the pigs began walking on two legs they also changed the maxim from ***four legs good, two legs bad*** to ***four legs good, two legs better***

#### Power corrupts
Napoleon and his pigs get stronger. They don't make decisions for the better of the animals but for the better of themselves
#### Education and learning
Education is good but at then end education was bad, because with education the animals would become smarter than the pigs
#### Language and power
With the right language Napoleon gains power. He makes empty promises, but these excite the animals
