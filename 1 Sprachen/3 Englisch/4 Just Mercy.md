## Plot
Law graduate Bryan Stevenson wants to help people who can't afford lawyers to defend themselves in court. He defends people who are on death row and are destined to be executed. Doing this he experiences racism and injustice. Often, people with a not so positive background or people of black colour face charges of murder despite lacking real evidence. Bryan gives it everything to save his clients. He couldn't save his first client, but was able to save a few.
